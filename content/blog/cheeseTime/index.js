One day, Willy mouse planned to throw a cheese party. 
So he invited his old friends and new friends to the party. 

When the friends arrived, he gave ** Cheese Tea **.

Then he gave ** Chesse with Cheese Chutney **. 

He gave more and more than his friends wanted.

His friends were Angry!

> Willie! How many cheese ? Hunh!!!
> You gave more than we wanted! 

Said his friends

> Next when you have a party, if you invite us, we will not come.
