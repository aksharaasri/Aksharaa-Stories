One day Bear Big the bear was walking.
Then he was hungry.
He wanted to eat fish.
When fishy fool the fish came out, the bear said

"Hey Fishy,  How are you?"

"Fine fine fine fine fine fine", said Fishy Fool the fish.

"Haaah, I want some fish. Fishy can I eat you?", said Bear big.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaa" said Fishy fool and ran away into the water. 

"What do I do now? hmmmmmmm?" thought Bear Big. 
"Aaah, an idea ! Let's go to the market and get some fish" He exclaimed. 

Now he wen't to Froggy Frog's shop in the market and Fishy fool laughed that he was able to make bear get a different idea.
