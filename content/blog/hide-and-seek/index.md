One day Boone dog wanted to play. 

> I must tell this to Bean Cat.

Thought Boone. 

He went and told Bean Cat

> Bean! I want to play. Can you please play with me?

> Ok. What game do you want to play Boone?

asked Bean.

> Hah! I want to play hide and seek

said Boone.


They played Hide & Seek. 

> Bean you hide first

said Boone.

> OoooKay! 

said Bean and went to hide himself. 

Then Boone started to count

> 1... 2... 3... 

When Boone was counting "five", Bean ran to a tree, climbed it and hid between the leaves. He didn't notice that his tail was out of the leaves. 

> ...98... 99.... 100!

Boone finished counting.

He noticed the tail of Bean hanging from the tree. 

> Found you Bean!  You are on top of the tree. I can see your tail. 

Shouted Boone. 

> Now I'll count

said Bean and started counting. 

> 1... 2... 3... 

Boone cannot climb the tree. So he went and hid in a bush. 

When Bean finished counting 

> ...98... 99.... 100!

He searched for Boone. 

> Boone.... Boone.... Where are you ?

Then Boone let a loud bark

> Wooooooof!

> Aahaaa! you are inside the bu...

But before Bean could finish his sentence, Boone ran to another nearby bush and hid himself. 

Again Boone let a loud bark

> Wooooooooof!

> Ah! now you are in the other bush. 

Said Bean.

But before he could say his words,  Boone again ran and hid inside another bush. 

This went on and on.  Bean was unable to find Boone. 

So Boone now hid himself inside the last bush. 

Finally, Bean finds him

> Yeeeeeeeeee! Booneee I see you now!

Said Bean happily 

Boone was smiling back as well as the game was very interesting.
