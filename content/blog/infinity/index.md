One day a baby number "8" was born to mother "8" and father "8". Baby "8" was a very good child.
But he soon came to know that baby "8" will only live for 8 days.

Baby "8" loved his parents very much and thought I want to live long with my parents. 

So baby "8" thought for a long time and then got an idea. 

He went to the mountain and asked. 

> Mountain... Mountain... Please can you make me live long?

![Mountain](./asks-mountain.jpg)

> I'm sorry, I cannot help you. See the sky, there is Sun. He will help you, 

said the mountain.


Baby "8" goes to meet the Sun and asks

> Sun... Sun... Can you please make me live long?

> Hmmmmm!!!, 

thought the Sun.

> Then I'll make you Infinity, 

said the Sun.

He cut the arms, legs and eyes of baby "8" and put the baby "8" in sleeping line. 
Then he put back it's arms, legs and eyes.

Now baby "8" became baby "&#8734;" and lived happily for ever.
