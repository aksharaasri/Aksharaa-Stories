Mole lived with her frog family and friends, julie jellyfish, ronald and robin snakes.
One day when she was going to school she lost her school bag and someone kidnapped her friends

> What!!! Where are my friends? 

said mole

After reaching home she told all the news.......

> Parents, my shool bag has been robbed.......

Before she finishes her father said

> You don't put your bag properly!!!


> LISTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Shouted mole

> My school bag has been robbed and my friends have been kidnapped and its gone to Mexico.
> So we have to find them and my bag

So they packed all the things and started their trip

On their way they reached a water forest.
There were many trees and also saw a lion fish come out of the cave.

ON THEIR WAY Uyoyo Walisde Matreso the "famous fish" came
Uyoyo Walisde Matreso had a bulluck cart with a 9 bedrooms 10 bathrooms 1 kitchen , 4 halls and driven by 100 horses!!!!!! WOOOOOW I want to go I want to go I want to go!!!!!!

> We are going to your city Mexico.
> Can you please help us?

Uyoyo Walisde Matreso said

> Call me UWM Youth
> and I will definitely help you.
> Come in my Rich bullock cart.

So they all travelled on the bullock cart to Mexico.

But mole did not realise that secret

**"THEY ARE GOING OUT OF THE WATER"**

> Habaada we are going out of the water

Asked mole

> Father and Mother frog go to the entrance, mole go to the back entrance. I'll go to find your bag

UWM youth said.

When mole went she saw her family photo and it was written down as "FINDING THEM"
Quickly she took her emergency phone and called UWM youth and said

> UWM youth please call my parents and say "hide yourself. the bad people are searching for us"


> YES!

said UWM youth 

When her parents heard it quickly they dressed like the old shark people they see in the road


they went to the door and said

> cccccan I come iiiin...


> yes

said a bold voice


>I'm huhuhuhungry can I eat you?
> nooooooooooooo

said an ugly shark, who was a bad man


Mole went to the back entrance and saw the ugly shark

> yuck!

said mole to herself dressed up like a nice city lady shark. She knocked

> Hi i am batony. nice to meet you.


> mooooommyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy come.

said the ugly shark and ran inside.

> k da

> hmhmhmhmhm hmhmhmhmhmhmhm mmmmmm hmhmhmhmmhmhmmmmhmhmhmhmhm mmmmhmmhmmhm

hummed a old lady, mother shark and went to the entrance.

Following the mother shark, came mole's parents. They have entered from the main door.


Mole peeped inside the room, she saw a big cupboard.
She asked the lady if she could open the cupboard.

>yaaru ma neengalla? yedhuku vandhurkinga? (who are you? why do you seek me)

She (the old lady)asked in another languege

> iva dha batony. iva americavulendhu vara. Naanga unga dhoorathu sondham.(she is batony. she is from america, we are your distant relatives)

said her parents

>indha side poitu nera 88 cm variku nadanga. 89 cm nadakadhinga oru jalimeenu rendu pambu iruku. Jaakaradhai (go to this side and go straight till 88 cm. Don't go 89 cm 1 jellyfish and 2 snakes are there. Be careful)

Mole was as happy as he could be. She along with her parents walked 89 cm and opened the door and saw her friends. She also went there and locked the door. 

At the night, she and her frends opened the door and escaped along with their parents.

Meanwhile UWM Youth found her bag and then came and joined them on their journey back home.
