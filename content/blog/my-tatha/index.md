description: A poem about my tatha for his 75th Birthday.
---
<p>
He was born to Lakshmi and Seshan

His grandfather worked in a station

Soon he came to Chennai

Not knowing he was about to fly high
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He worked for State Government

He married Jaya after engagement

Blessed with children Arun and Hari

He had no need to worry.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He is a lovely man

Doing things that he can

Loving the work he does

going to work through Luz
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He retired in 2004

He lived at home. Oh! What a bore!

Now he is taking classes

An opportunity he never misses.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It is his 75th Birthday today

With 3 grandchildren to play

Amithu, Anvi and Akshu

Long life and happiness we wish YOU.
</p>
