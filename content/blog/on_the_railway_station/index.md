On the railway station near my house, there is a parrot that lives on a hole. 
The Parrot is a very naughty parrot.


It went in and out. When any other parrots come it will chase them out.
It was a very rowdy parrot.


It says 
> keech keech keech keech.
One day the parrot slept off.


We waited waited waited waited waited.
It did not come.

Soon night fell.
We went to sleep.

> ZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

Tommorrow we went.
It woke up and told us the story why it did not come


> I dozed off that noon, that is why i did not come out.

Silly parrot!
