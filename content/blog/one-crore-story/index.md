Once a "One" was living in the number land. She was so sad that she is only "One".

All the other numbers teased her.  Her only friend was "Zero" who was smaller than her. 

One day, "One" told "Zero".

> All the other numbers make fun of us as we are the smallest. We need to teach them a lesson.

"Zero" replied, 

> Yes you are right. I'll call all my other friends tomorrow. 


Next day when "One" woke up, she saw "Zero" with her friend "Zeroes" next to her. There were totally seven "Zeroes".

Together they became a "Crore".  From that day onwards, all the other numbers were friendly to "One" and "Zero".
