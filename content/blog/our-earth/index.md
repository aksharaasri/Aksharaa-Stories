<p>
Earth is a sphere,
  
That's what we hear,
  
Earth is round,
  
That's what Astronauts found.
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
22nd of April is here,
  
Day we celebrate and cheer,
  
Because it is Earth's birthday,
  
Remember to make it a worth day.
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  
Coal, petroleum and Gas,
  
If we burn it, it goes Jazz.
  
Making our earth very very hot,
  
Melting glaciers and plants to rot.
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  
Earth has air, geo-thermal, water,
  
Which when used can make life better,
  
This will keep the earth cool,
  
Bringing rain that fills the pool.
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
Earth day is on April 22nd,
  
Let us remember it every second,
  
To save our earth we take an vow,
  
Planting trees starting from now.
<p>
