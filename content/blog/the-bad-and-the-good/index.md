Fur Fur the villain mouse said, 
> Won't you fight with me? I'll kill all the mouse of this land. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

Mullu called Millu the Good mouse. 

Mullu the magician mouse made an electric ball and said to Millu. 

> Millu, just see what I've done. Roll this ball and Kill Fur Fur

Millu the mouse said

> Okaaaaaaay!

He pushed the ball and ball went against Fur Fur and dashed him. 

Fur Fur said 
> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
