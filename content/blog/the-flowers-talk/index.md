One day all the flowers were talking. 

Lilly said 
> I float on water. I've leaves for safety. I float with their help.

Rose Said
> Never mind. Somebody plucked me and present me to someone they love.

Marigold said
> Never mind. Why did they name me Marigold? I'm just orange.

Rose replied
> Marigold, everybody loves you. You are so precious, that is why you are Mari**Gold**.

All the flowers asked Marigold
> Why are the butterflies taking nectare from me?

Marigold said
> Because they love honey and you all are sweet. 

All the flowers winked at Marigold.

Just then a butterfly came to drink nectare from everyone, 

Everyone Laughed Happily
> Ha Ha Ha Ha !!!
